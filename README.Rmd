Synthetic data on deaths and population in Australia.


## Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("bayesiandemography/synmort")
```

## Description

**synmort** contains a single data frame
(called `synmort`) with synthetic data for Australia
on population and deaths, disaggregated by age, sex,
Indigenous status, state/territory and time. The methods used
to split age groups and impute deaths have introduced substantial
errors into the synthetic data, and they do *not* accurately
measure actual mortality patterns in Australia.
They are intended purely for developing code that can 
subsequently be used on real data.

```{r}
library(synmort)
head(synmort)
```
