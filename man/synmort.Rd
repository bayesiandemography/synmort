\description{
A synthetic dataset of deaths and population
created by splitting out tabulations published
by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The
splitting method is very simple, and does not produce
accurate rates or counts: the data should
absolutely \emph{not} be used for estimating actual mortality
rates in Australia. The data should instead be
use for developing code that will ultimately
be used on real data, probably in
a secure environment.
}
\details{
The starting point for the synthetic data is
the table "Deaths, Year of registration,
Indigenous status, Age at death, Sex, Five State/Territory"
in the \href{https://explore.data.abs.gov.au}{Data Explorer database}
on the Australian Bureau of Statistics website.
The population counts and
age-specific mortality rates, which the ABS publishes
with broad age groups, are split into single
year of age, using splines. Synthetic death counts
are then generated by drawing from Poisson distributions.
The original data and the code to create the synthetic
data are included in the 'data-raw'
folder for this package.
